## Why Use a To-Do App?

### A To-Do App allows us to:
* Organizing our tasks with a list can make everything much more manageable and make us feel grounded. Seeing a clear outline of your completed and uncompleted tasks will help you feel organized and stay mentally focused.
* To-do lists are a useful external memory aid that give us permission to forget. As long as we can remember to look at our to-do list, we will never lose anything that we have recorded on it.
